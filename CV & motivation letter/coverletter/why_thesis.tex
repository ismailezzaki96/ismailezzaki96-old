	 \lettersection{Why this thesis?}
This thesis combines two of my favorite fields: physics \& data science.

Also, this thesis matches exactly with my research interest and the requirements needed for this Ph.D. thesis closely match my background and skills:  computational physics, data analysis.%, and Machine \& Deep Learning.

In addition, the new computational challenges presented by this thesis, and thinking about innovative ways to tackle them are great motivations for me, and pursuing my Ph.D. with experts and researching the latest topics of physics is my childhood dream.
