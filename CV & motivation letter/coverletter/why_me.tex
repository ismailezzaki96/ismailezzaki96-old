\lettersection{Why me}
%I like to work in team and possess friendly attitude towards colleagues and mentors. I always try to deal with challenging organisational tasks because it helps me to train communicational skills and better understand people around. Thus, I received great pleasure working with high school students last summer when I assisted their laboratory classes and led an excursions for them around labs and experimental facilities of our Department. During my internship I was involved in various extra activities and obtained such useful skills as conducting a patent search and writing applications for research grants. Among activities beyond University campus I want to mention my energetic participation in life of a local English Debating Club and my favorite hobby, which is mountaineering and long-distance walking treks. Through this experience I strengthened my organizational capacity because several times I was responsible for planning of a route for a group.
% Besides my thorough theoretical knowledge got during my master in high energy and computational physics, I also possess strong numerical and data analysis skills obtained during multiple research projects, also I have a lot of experience in programming languages (Python and C++) and frameworks (ROOT, TMVA ..), and I have a strong desire for professional development. I believe that my diligence, my practical research experience, and organizing abilities, high enthusiasm, and interest in particle physics are most conducive to make me an ideal candidate for this Ph.D.
