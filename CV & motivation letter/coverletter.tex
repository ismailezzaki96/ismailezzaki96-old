I graduated last year with a Master’s degree in “high energy physics and computational physics” from Cadi Ayyad University in Morocco.

I am comfortable dealing with several difficult things at once. This ability helps me to succeed in my studies (  \nth{2}  in my master's class) and to gain extracurricular knowledge in the field of computer science (about 5 years of experience in programming).

Since my childhood, I have always been interested in discovering how things work. So I chose to study physics, like many children. I always dreamed of winning a Nobel Prize in physics, but as I grew up, I switched to a more realistic dream: to become a university researcher.

My interest in programming started about five years ago when I had my first contact with computer coding in school by creating a small website. From there, I gained extracurricular programming skills in C++ and Python, and I also gained skills in data analysis and machine learning.

I worked on many data analysis projects in particle physics. You can find some information about them in my CV.

I didn’t work on a project related to detector module development but I took during my master’s studies and summer school in particle physics in Italy theoretical knowledge about triggering and acquiring data for physics experiments, Microelectronic technologies for HEP Instrumentation, CMS and ATLAS detector components, also I am a quick learner, and I am able to grasp new concepts quickly and efficiently. 

I believe that my diligence, practical research experience, organizational skills, great enthusiasm, and interest in computational physics all make me an ideal candidate for this Ph.D.

\end{cvletter}
%My previous voluntary experience in addition to my passion for effective communication, professionalism, and hard work make me a strong candidate for this position. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Thank you for your time and consideration.
